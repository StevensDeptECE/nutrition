AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with kidney stones are counseled to eat a diet low in animal 
      protein, sodium, and oxalate and rich in fruits and vegetables, with a modest amount 
      of calcium, usually from dairy products. Restriction of sodium, potassium, and 
      oxalate may also be recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease. Recently, 
      plant-based diets have gained popularity owing to health, environmental, and animal 
      welfare considerations. Our objective was to compare concentrations of ingredients 
      important for kidney stones and chronic kidney disease in popular brands of milk 
      alternatives. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sodium, calcium, and potassium contents were 
      obtained from nutrition labels. The oxalate content was measured by ion 
      chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The calcium content is 
      highest in macadamia followed by soy, almond, rice, and dairy milk; it is lowest in 
      cashew, hazelnut, and coconut milk. Almond milk has the highest oxalate 
      concentration, followed by cashew, hazelnut, and soy. Coconut and flax milk have 
      undetectable oxalate levels; coconut milk also has comparatively low sodium, 
      calcium, and potassium, while flax milk has the most sodium. Overall, oat milk has 
      the most similar parameters to dairy milk (moderate calcium, potassium and sodium 
      with low oxalate). Rice, macadamia, and soy milk also have similar parameters to 
      dairy milk. CONCLUSION: As consumption of plant-based dairy substitutes increases, 
      it is important for healthcare providers and patients with renal conditions to be 
      aware of their nutritional composition. Oat, macadamia, rice, and soy milk compare 
      favorably in terms of kidney stone risk factors with dairy milk, whereas almond and 
      cashew milk have more potential stone risk factors. Coconut milk may be a favorable 
      dairy substitute for patients with chronic kidney disease based on low potassium, 
      sodium, and oxalate. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of 
      plant-based milk alternatives on urine chemistry.
